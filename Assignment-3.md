### Assignment ###

For this assignment, you will be working as a team.

You will be starting an implementation project for a clinical decision support
system.  As the project managers, you are responsible for identifying the key
issues within your hospital (e.g. legal/regulatory, organizational/cultural,
software/IT, and clinical workflows) and creating a plan for addressing these
issues.  I will be reading this assignment from the perspective of your head of
informatics.  While you won't be able to cover everything in great detail, the
goal is to cover enough that the project can be successfully kicked off (with
respect to your particular topic).

Given your current positions and extensive experience and background, I am
assuming that you have experience planning and executing implementation
projects.  You will also be focusing on a project as part of your program.  As
such, this is an opportunity for a focused dive into a particular area of
interest ***to you***.

For example, you may choose to focus on addressing the organizational or
cultural issues within your organization.  You may focus on the knowledge
management portion, or data capture and semantic interoperability.  As we
discussed in class, there are quite a few different areas to focus on and I
would choose one that you are either uncomfortable with or would like to learn
more about.Whatever you choose, please make it explicit and clear because there
is a natural overlap between all aspects of the project.  By letting me know
the specific area you're focusing on, I will be able to keep that context in
mind as I read through your assignment.

Some areas to consider are:

- Organizational issues
- Cultural issues
- Change management
- Knowledge management
- Data extraction and interoperability

**As soon as you feel like you have a topic of interest and have discussed it
with your team in the context of your CDS tool, please create an outline and
then check in and discuss with me via email or Zoom to make sure we're all on
the same page and that your topic is not too large nor too small**

As with any implementation project, this is your one opportunity to put the
framework and structure in place to guide the implementation.  Anything left
out or forgotten during this phase may have drastic consequences later.  For
example, it may be easiest to say that you will not perform any upgrades to the
software once the algorithms have been tested and deployed.  This is often the
case with algorithms embedded inside bedside monitors such as EKG's.
Obviously, this prevents you from ever deploying future versions, whether as an
incremental improvement or as a critical bugfix.  On the other hand, if you
incorporate an upgrade cycle, you must then add a plan for testing of the new
system alongside the currently deployed one.

As I mentioned during the intensive, the only wrong decision is an uninformed
and unjustified one.

Given that each group will likely choose a different area of focus, it is
difficult to list out the specific questions I'd like you to address because it
is highly dependent on the use case.  However, to give you a sense of the level
of depth I'd like you to achieve, imagine if your chosen area is
legal/regulatory.  Some questions you would want to address (and justify) are:

1. Is this predominantly a software or hardware product?
2. What liabilities may exist if this is a software product?
3. What if you just add a blanket warning, "This software is intended to help
   you view the data more conveniently.  Any decisions you make must be yours
   alone, based on your training, expertise, and licensure as a clinician." - is
   this enough?
4. Should you have a different warning or disclaimer?
5. Does this need to be pushed through the FDA before you use it with real
   patients?
6. What are the implications if you want to upgrade the software?
7. What is the process for training users?
8. Will users be able to use this from personal devices?  Mobile phones,
   tablets, laptops?

That said, you should address the following points **at a minimum**.

1. Describe the clinical or business need underlying your CDS tool
2. Describe your CDS tool and how it will help improve the decision-making process
3. Review the 5 components of CDS (page 39 of the slides) and discuss each in
   the context of your project
4. Focus on your implementation topic of interest and work through it.  Your
   goal should be to effectively and adequately address that particular issue.  In
   other words, as the head informatcist on your implementation team, I should
   feel comfortable starting on the project and believe that we have an successful
   plan in place

The assigned reading and optional readings should give you a general starting
point.  There are additional chapters of Greenes that I can make available if
requested.  Additionally, please conduct your own research using journal
papers, articles, blog posts and any other resources you would reasonably
consider as part of an actual implementation.  At the doctoral level, the goal
is to get you to start thinking about and attacking problems for which there
may not be a clearcut answer or approach.  So, please do as much (or as little)
research as you need and be creative!

**Deliverables**

For this assignment, the primary deliverable is a project plan/report.  Please
include figures, diagrams, etc. as you see fit.  There is no length
requirement.  The goal is to effectively communicate your plan and justify your
approach as appropriate.
