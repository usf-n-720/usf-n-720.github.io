HS 614 provides a broad survey of clinical decision support and statistical and
machine learning algorithms.  Unlike a more computer science or statistics
oriented course, HS 614 focuses on the link between analytics and clinical
decision support systems.  A significant portion of the course is spent
reviewing the organizational, cultural, legal, and ethical implications of
analytics within healthcare.
